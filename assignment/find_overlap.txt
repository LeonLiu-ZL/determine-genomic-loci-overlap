This program determines if two genomic loci are overlapped or not.
The program create a function called find_overlap, which takes in two genomic loci as inputs.
The loci are in the format of "chr:start-end".
The function first parses the input loci and checks if they are in correct format.
If the inputs are in correct format, the function will check if they are on the same chromosome and if they are overlapped.
The function returns False if the two loci are not overlapped, returns True if they are overlapped.

1. Create an exception class with a message attribute: InvalidInputError. It is raised when the loci inputs are not valid. 
      Error message:'Error: The locus inputs are not found. An example of the locus inputs: "chr1:1-100".'

2. Creat a function: find_overlap, which takes two string arguments: locus_x and locus_y.

      Split the locus_x and locus_y by ":". Assign the results in locus_x_coord and locus_y_coord respectively.
      If the length of locus_x_coord or locus_y_coord is not equal to 2, 
          raise InvalidInputError.
      Otherwise, extract the chromosome information from locus_x_coord and locus_y_coord. Assign them in locus_x_chr and locus_y_chr respectively.
      If locus_x_chr or locus_y_chr does not start with "chr", 
          raise InvalidInputError.
    
      Split the locus_x_coord and locus_y_coord strings by "-". Assign the results in locus_x_pos and locus_y_pos respectively.
      If the length of locus_x_pos or locus_y_pos is not equal to 2, 
          raise InvalidInputError.
      Otherwise, extract the start and stop positions from locus_x_pos and locus_y_pos. Assign them in locus_x_start, locus_y_start, locus_x_stop, and locus_y_stop respectively.
      
      If the locus_x_chr is not equal to locus_y_chr, 
          return False.
      Otherwise, assign the overlap_start as the maximum of locus_x_start and locus_y_start and assign overlap_end as the minimum of locus_x_stop and locus_y_stop respectively.
      If overlap_start is less than or equal to overlap_end, 
          return True.
      Otherwise, 
          return False.
